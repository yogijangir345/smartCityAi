## 📌 Problem Statement  

Traffic problems in cities are a big issue.  
The traffic signals work on fixed timers and don’t change according to real traffic.  
This causes traffic jams, waste of fuel, and delays for emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  

We made a Smart Traffic AI system that controls traffic lights based on real-time data.  

- It uses cameras to count how many vehicles are on the road.  
- Then AI decides when to change the traffic lights.  
- It can also give priority to emergency vehicles by making green signals for them.  
- This helps reduce traffic jams and saves fuel and time.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. Cameras watch the traffic live.  
2. Our system counts vehicles using OpenCV.  
3. AI predicts how traffic will change soon.  
4. Traffic lights change timing based on traffic conditions.  
5. Emergency vehicles get green signals automatically.  
6. Data helps plan better traffic management in the future.
